# Super Bag
This add-on check your bags for poor quality items when you interact with a Merchant and sell any that it finds. It also displays your number of remaining bag slots over the backpack icon. 

This is a work in progress and will include more features including blacklists for grey items you don't want to sell. Sorting options, and custom options for the remaining bag slots display.
